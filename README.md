KuNG FU (KiNase Gene FUsion) is a novel homogeneous user-friendly on line database collecting the largest manually curated catalogue of annotated, potentially active and experimentally validated kinase gene fusions identified in cancer cell lines. Only in-frame kinase gene fusions retaining an intact catalytic domain were included, to offer a druggable set of kinase gene fusion targets characterized in cancer cell line models. The KuNG FU database was developed and made available online to support the strong interest in kinase gene fusion research models in drug development and diagnostic tool design, often hampered by a lack of exhaustive and convenient specific databases.
